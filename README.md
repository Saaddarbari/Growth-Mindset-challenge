## 🚀 Growth Mindset Challenge: Web App with Streamlit 🚀
Welcome to my latest project, built using Python and Streamlit, as part of the Growth Mindset Challenge! This repository showcases two applications designed to solve real-world problems and enhance the user experience.

# 📌 Quarter 3 Assignment 1: XLSX to CSV Converter Web App
This web app allows users to:

Upload an XLSX file and convert it to CSV (and vice versa).
Download the converted file instantly for easy access.
It’s a simple yet effective tool for handling data in different formats, making it easier for users to work with spreadsheets across platforms.

# 📌 Personal Finance Tracker
Additionally, this repository features a Personal Finance Tracker, which helps users:

Track their income and expenses.
Manage savings and gain better control over their finances.
Visualize financial data for better budgeting and expense tracking.
# 💡 Key Learnings & Growth Mindset
This challenge allowed me to dive deep into problem-solving, persistence, and innovation—all essential aspects of a growth mindset. By building these apps, I applied my Python and Streamlit skills to create something valuable for users.
